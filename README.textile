h2. Installation

This is a standard GeoDjango project. Install PostgreSQL and GeoDjango - I just "followed the instructions":http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/gis/install/.

One thing - I'm on Debian lenny, and not only is the PostGIS that is installed missing SRID 900913, as the GeoDjango docs tell you, but SRID 27700 (British National Grid, and therefore quite important in this application) is incorrect.  After you've installed and got a PostGIS template, log in to it and update the proj4text column of SRID 27700 to include +datum=OSGB36.

Download the relevant OS data from "their website":http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/opendata (or "mySociety's mirror":http://parlvid.mysociety.org:81/os/) - you want one or more of the 1:50k Gazetteer (place names), Code-Point Open (postcodes), and OS Locator (street names).

Once you've unzipped the files, you can import the data using the management commands included, e.g.

bc. cat 50k.txt | ./manage.py import_places
cat oslocator.txt | ./manage.py import_roads
cat postcodes/*.csv | ./manage.py import_postcodes

Make sure DEBUG is False, otherwise you'll soon run out of memory as it tries to remember all the SQL queries made.

That should be all you need to do - start up the dev web server, or whatever.

h2. Todo

* I've tried to make this a standalone Django app, but the CSS is currently in the project, not the app.  Other than that (which someone is welcome to fix), it should hopefully just slot in to any Django project; but I've probably done something wrong.

* The postcode and reverse geocoding work well, as they're quite simple; the place and street name lookups could certainly be improved upon.

Any comments or questions, do get in touch.
